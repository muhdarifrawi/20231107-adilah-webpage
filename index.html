                        There was a bunch of ideas that can be branched out from 
                        this topic such as the food culture, festivals commonly 
                        celebrated, the music culture. However, these ideas are 
                        also too vague and can be lengthy. Since Singapore is a 
                        diverse community with different cultures and religion, 
                        it can be tedious to talk about the common food or festivals.

                    <p class="font-lora">
                        I have chosen music as my design process. Music comes in 
                        various forms, however, I wanted to talk more of the 
                        classics as well as tradition. In Singapore, when we 
                        talk about classical, it has always been the Symphony 
                        Orchestra. It consists of the western instruments such 
                        as the harp, tuba, trombone, cello, violin and 
                        few others. South Korea, on the other hand, has their 
                        own traditional music, Jeongak, which means “right 
                        (or proper) music”. This includes both instrumental and 
                        vocal music which were cultivated mainly by the upper 
                        class of Joseon society. Instruments include janggu, 
                        haegum, piri, gayageum, buk.

                        Overall, the composition of the final design is decided 
                        after multiple consideration of sizes and placements 
                        that would allow people to view the few different types 
                        of instruments these two countries incorporate in their 
                        classical or traditional music.

                        This work is set in the future. With advancement of technologies, the older ones get
                        discarded rather quick. I illustrated the cat with a half and half robotic parts and the skin of it
                        to show that it has been there for years/ decades yet remains steady/ carefree. The tree
                        represents the peaceful and quiet environment in the junkyard. Although it might have been
                        run down, the tree remains strong. The boBom part of the art where there are fishes
                        represents the tranquillity of the area. It is depicted in full white to indicate that those are
                        the souls of the fishes who had passed in the making of a tech world.
                        For the mediums/techniques I used for this work. The cat and the bark of the tree are done
                        using the hatching/cross-hatching in pens and the rest are done using the mark making
                        technique in Chinese ink.
